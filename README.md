# JS-Drumkit
JS Drumkit based on Wes Bos' [tutorial #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuN8qwZoego)

I've updated a little bit of the styling because I've been always fascinated by the simplicity of synths like the OP-1, or the KORG nanopads, cause those buttons are just screaming to push them.

Feel free to [play around with it](https://javpet.github.io/JS-Drumkit/), fork it and add your own sounds and controls! The possibilities are endless. ðŸ™Œ
